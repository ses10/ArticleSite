# ArticleSite
Frontend, Backend, and DB connection properties are all bundled together in a single project for easy setup and demonstration.
<br><br>Note: I would never hardcode DB connection properties in repo or production :)

## Importing and running the project
After cloning and importing to your favorite IDE you should immediately be able to run the project from "ArticleSiteApplication.java"<br>
<br>Or just run the included jar "java -jar ArticleSite-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"

Frontend url: http://localhost:8080/
<br>Backend url: http://localhost:8080/articles?page=0&size=10
